Then, he brought the four statues from Dhanyavadi to be worshipped in the capital of Amarapura. The people of Dhanyavadi also requested that one statue be left for them to worship, so he left the statue of Shin Kyaw Muni. Then, they brought the three statues. They camped above the village of Sinte on the west bank of Lam Kulaap.  Then, the villagers of the nearby village asked for a sacred image to worship, so they left the Shwe Bon Samuni statue.
